Ledger is an accounting program which is invoked from the command-line
using a textual ledger file.  To start using Ledger, you will need to
create such a file containing your financial transactions.  A sample
has been provided in the file "sample.dat".  See the documentation
(ledger.pdf, or ledger.info) for full documentation on creating a
ledger file and using Ledger to generate reports.
