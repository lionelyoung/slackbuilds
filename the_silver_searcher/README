The Silver Searcher is a code searching tool with a focus on
speed. Searches entire trees by default while ignoring Subversion,
Git and other VCS directories and other files that aren't your
source code.

Use this to save a lot of keystrokes, since the binary is named "ag" and it
searches the tree by default.
