# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pynzb:
pynzb: NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP
pynzb: (Usenet) servers. Since NZB is XML-based, it's relatively
pynzb: easy to build one-off parsers to parse NZB files. This project is
pynzb: an attempt to consolidate those many one-off NZB parsers into one
pynzb: simple interface.
