The aim of this package is to unify the plethora of existing packages integrating SQLAlchemy with Zope's transaction management. As such it seeks only to provide a data manager and makes no attempt to define a zopeish way to configure engines.

You need to understand SQLAlchemy for this package and this README to make any sense. See http://sqlalchemy.org/docs/.
