Reckon automagically converts CSV files for use with the command-line
accounting tool Ledger. It also helps you to select the correct accounts
associated with the CSV data using Bayesian machine learning.

First, login to your bank and export your transaction data as a CSV file.

To see how the CSV parses:
  reckon -f bank.csv -p

To convert to ledger format and label everything, do:
  reckon -f bank.csv -o output.dat

To have reckon learn from an existing ledger file, provide it with -l:
  reckon -f bank.csv -l 2010.dat -o output.dat
