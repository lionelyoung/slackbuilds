Beancount is a double-entry accounting system that uses a simple text file format as input.  A few Python scripts are used to parse the contents of the file, for example, to serve the contents as a locally running web server.  Scripts are provided to convert from OFX files into Ledger input format, and other formats (easily extensible).

The ideas and syntax is entirely inspired by John Wiegley's Ledger, and the syntax is pretty much compatible with it. Beancount's syntax is a subset of Ledger (a little more restrictive), with a few additional directives. You should probably read Ledger's documentation in order to you use Beancount: http://github.com/downloads/jwiegley/ledger/ledger.pdf

Beancount provides a simple web front to view the contents of the database, so you don't have to parse the entire file everytime you want to view a different account (this helps mitigate the fact that parsing is comparatively slow).
