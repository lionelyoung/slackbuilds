# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

beancount: beancount (command-line double-entry accounting)
beancount:
beancount: Beancount is a double-entry accounting system that uses a simple text
beancount: file format as input.  The ideas and syntax is entirely inspired by
beancount: John Wiegley's ledger, and the syntax is pretty much compatible
beancount: with it. A few Python scripts are used to parse the contents of
beancount: the file, for example, to serve the contents as a locally running
beancount: web server.  Scripts are provided to convert from OFX files into
beancount: Ledger input format, and other formats (easily extensible).
