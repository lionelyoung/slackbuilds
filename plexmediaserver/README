Plex Media Server is the backend for the Plex media system.

Plex's frontend media player, Plex Home Theater, is Windows/Mac only; however,
you can stream your local files on Linux from your web browser.  Plex Home
Theater allows the user to manage and play video, photos, music, and podcasts
from a local or remote computer running Plex Media Server.  

Plex Media Server runs as its own user, plex:plex (UID/GID: 350)

After installing, grab an account from https://my.plexapp.com/ and visit
http://localhost:32400/manage to configure your server
