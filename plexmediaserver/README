Plex Media Server is the backend for the Plex media system.

Plex's frontend media player, Plex Home Theater, is Windows/Mac only;
however, you can stream your local files on Linux from your web browser.
Plex Home Theater allows the user to manage and play video, photos, music,
and podcasts from a local or remote computer running Plex Media Server.

Plex Media Server runs as plex:plex (UID/GID 279) with its $HOME as
/var/lib/plexmediaserver:

# groupadd -g 279 plex
# useradd -u 279 -d /var/lib/plexmediaserver -s /bin/false -g plex plex

After installing, grab an account from https://my.plexapp.com/ and visit
http://localhost:32400/manage to configure your server.
